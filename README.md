# image-processing-filters-opencv
Classical image processing techniques (filters, edge detection, thresholding, segmentation) implemented in Python with OpenCV.
# 🖼️ Classical Image Processing with OpenCV & Python  

 # 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates  classical image processing techniques using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  
It covers filtering, edge detection, thresholding, morphological operations, and segmentation, all visualized with side-by-side comparisons of original and processed images.  

# Features  
✅ Gaussian Blur (smoothing, noise reduction)  
✅ Sobel Edge Detection (gradient-based edges)  
✅ Canny Edge Detection (multi-stage edge detection)  
✅ Binary Thresholding  
✅ Otsu’s Thresholding (automatic threshold selection)  
✅ Morphological Operations (erosion, dilation)  
✅ Watershed Segmentation (object separation)
